# Kentucky Digital Library Metadata Guidelines ![KDL logo](kdl_logo.png)

Updated August 2013
<hr/>

## 1 Introduction

>*The Kentucky Digital Library (KDL) is built to enhance scholarship, research and lifelong learning through the establishment of access to shared digital archival collections in the state of Kentucky. It also provides guidance and instruction for Kentucky libraries, archives, historical societies and museums on applying appropriate technologies used in the production of digital library resources.*
</blockquote>
- from the mission statement

The Kentucky Digital Library is a statewide resource whose infrastructure is managed by the University of Kentucky's Digital Library Services. KDL also serves as regional hub for the Digital Public Library of America. These guidelines are intended to support the aim of providing technological guidance to the diversity of participating cultural heritage institutions whose unique collections comprise the KDL. In turn, well-formed and consistent metadata will support effective long-term preservation, enhance discovery and improve interoperability. Ultimately, good metadata helps users by making sure Kentucky's digitized cultural heritage collections are accessible and searchable, now and in the future.

###### **Specifically, these guidelines are designed to:**
- cover basic metadata principles and best practices
- increase transparency by describing KDL's workflows and processes regarding metadata
- provide specifications and practical examples for descriptive metadata fields
- facilitate effective reuse of existing descriptions already created by contributors, such as cataloging records and finding aids 

### 1.1 Metadata Overview

Robust models for describing digital objects categorize metadata as either descriptive, administrative and structural. While useful, these categories can overlap in several areas if they are not further defined. KDL generates much of the administrative and structural metadata describing objects and collections through automated processes. On the other hand, KDL believes contributors know their own collections best, and KDL depends on them to provide descriptive metadata that will best facilitate discovery. At the same time, contributed metadata should adhere to best practices where at all possible in order to make the most of KDL's existing infrastructure and any systems that rely on KDL's data, such as the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA).

These guidelines are designed in the effort to balance the diversity of descriptions associated with contributed collections and the technical needs of systems that rely on KDL data, such as the DPLA. In practice, KDL largely consists of material contributed by special collections and archives and has made every effort to incorporate aspects of standards appropriate to those collections, especially Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS) and Encoded Archival Description (EAD). KDL recognizes three levels of "required-ness" across descriptive metadata fields -- required, required if available and recommended. It also includes recommended fields specific to collection level records that make best use of existing finding aids.

###### **Required fields must be submitted in order for content to be ingested:**
- format
- Kentucky-specific subject
- language
- resource type
- rights
- title

###### **Required if available**
- creator
- date
- source

###### **Recommended**

KDL describes a number of additional fields that map to common description and cataloging standards. We highly recommend that contributors submit all fields appropriate to existing descriptive metadata that may have previously been collected in finding aid, accession record or catalog record by contributing institution.

**Collection level**

KDL provides a number of recommended fields specific to collection level records in order to capture information contained in finding aids that may not be appropriate for item level records.

### 1.2 Clarifications 

**Items and Collections**

There are two types of records that may be entered: those that describe individual items and those that describe collections of items. Fields that only pertain to collections appear in the recommended fields section and generally include information that would appear in a finding aid.

**Source Material**

In the case of digitized collections as opposed to born-digital materials, the metadata fields as they are construed here privilege the source material. While the fields descriptions in the following section should make that explicit, occasionally ambiguity may arise, in which case contributors should opt for descriptions of the original source material.

**Character Encoding**

KDL encodes metadata records using UTF-8 character encoding, which supports a range of foreign characters. We encourage contributors to adhere as closely to information as it appears on the original record, for example, including accented characters in the title of records or the names of contributors.

**Dates**

To enhance discoverability and automated maintenance processes, KDL requires the use of ISO 8601 for the entry of the most date fields; in other words, KDL uses the standard form of YYYY-MM-DD. This is used in Date, Terminal Date, Date Range Start and Date Range End fields.

Dates appear in other fields as well, and we encourage the strict use of the same format where applicable. In practice, this will usually be to indicate a year (YYYY) or range of years (YYYY-YYYY). A question mark(?) to indicate uncertainty and a tilde(~) to indicate an approximate date can be placed immediately before a year (~1800-?1900). 

While free text dates may appear in many fields, they most commonly appear in Creator, Contributor, Temporal Coverage, Collection Label, Series Statement and Bulk Date fields

**Authority Lists and Controlled Vocabulary**

Wherever possible we encourage authority lists and controlled vocabulary over free text submission in order to enhance discoverability and interoperability. In addition to Library of Congress Authorities and the Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus, KDL maintains a number of subsets specific to Kentucky related collections. In the case of Kentucky-specific subsets of broader standards, options will appear in drop down menus in the metadata editor.

## 2 Data Fields

### 2.1 How to Use this Manual

###### Descriptive metadata fields submitted by contributors appear below with the following fields:

**Resources:** [EAD <bioghist\>](http://www.loc.gov/ead/tglib/elements/bioghist.html)

#### Bulk Date

The date or dates describing the predominant date range during which records in a collection were created. This is useful when there is a significant discrepancy between the earliest or latest records and the bulk of record creation.

This date is entered as free text and can be a date (YYYY-MM-DD), a year (YYYY) or span of years (YYYY-YYYY).

#### Collection Label

**Repeatable:** No

**Scheme:** Free text

## Appendix A: Ingest Processes Overview

Once a project is actively being processed, digital objects undergo a number of steps so that when files are later retrieved KDL can ensure they are complete and have not been unintentionally modified. KDL models its system after the Open Archives Initiatives System (OAIS) which, roughly speaking, divides preservation into three stages: submission, archiving and dissemination. At each stage, a packet of information including metadata and data files is generated and passed onto the next for further processing.

Metadata is actually served as JSON files that can later be reassembled according to whatever structure is necessary. This facilitiates reuse by multiple systems because no rigid structure is implied. For example, metadata can be recombined and structured to meet different requirements, such as DPLA's metadata harvester or a DACS compliant EAD.

**1 Submission**

Data files, paired with basic descriptive information such as format, are put into an ingest queue, something like a bulletin board listing upcoming projects.

**2 SIP**

The first stage of processing is creating a Submission Information Packet (SIP). Files are copied into a workspace and associated with appropriate administrative and structural metadata. Files might be further processed, for example, images of printed text might be scanned using Optical Text Recognition (OCR). 

**3 Identifiers**

The data, metadata and any derivative files are then packaged and given unique identifiers. The Archival Information Packet(AIP) identifier will accompany the package of information that will be archived and stored without being accessed. The Dissemination Information Packet(DIP) identifier will accompany the package of information that will be stored on the server accessed by KDL's online interface.

**4 Approval**

Before being archived or moved to access storage, packages undergo testing to make sure that files and metadata are complete.

**5 Storage**

Lastly, packages are moved to their appropriate servers and a version of the metadata is added to KDL's index. Archival packages are secure within a preservation repository and dissemination packages are now searchable online. Any temporary files are cleaned up and the process can begin again.
